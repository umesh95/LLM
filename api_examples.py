    Machine learning, a subset of AI, has become particularly prominent in recent years. Unlike traditional 
    programming where developers write explicit instructions for computers to follow, machine learning systems 
    learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. Deep learning, which 
    uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain, has achieved remarkable success in areas such 
    as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. The applications of AI in modern 
    society are vast and growing rapidly. In healthcare, AI systems are being used to analyze medical images, 
    assist in drug discovery, and even predict patient outcomes.
